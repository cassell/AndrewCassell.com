# The Best Damn Smoked Ribs and Pulled Pork

This simple recipe and guide will teach you how to make exceptional [Kansas City-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City-style_barbecue) smoked baby back ribs and pulled pork that are better than all but the top echelon of BBQ restaurants. For an example of BBQ this won't beat go to [Oklahoma Joe's in Kansas City, Kansas](http://oklahomajoesbbq.com/). We'll be making 2 full racks of ribs and an 9 pound pork shoulder. This will be enough to serve 6-8 very hungry adults, with everybody getting a few ribs and plenty of pulled pork. This is about max capacity on Weber Smokey Mountain smoker without using a [rack system for the ribs](http://store.weber.com/accessories/category/cook/cookware/1280).

<blockquote>Note: I've <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development">iterated</a> several times on this recipe and will continue to make updates if I am able to improve it.</blockquote>

## A day or two before smoking:
Ok, let's start with the ribs: Buy baby back ribs. They will taste better and be less fatty than spare ribs. They will only cost a little bit more (if you are going spend a day cooking then you deserve it). Buy ribs that look like they are meaty, trimmed well, and don't show any bone through the inside of the rib cage (these are called "[shiners](http://www.weber.com/weber-nation/grill-skills/mastering-ribs/know-your-cuts__1/what-is-a-shiner)"). I've had great luck with baby back ribs from Wegman's, Whole Foods, and Trader Joes. Buy ribs that are fresh and far from the expiration date.
<blockquote>Note: I'm still iterating my spare rib recipe and if I can make them as good as the baby backs I will post results.</blockquote>

For the pork shoulder I typically buy an 8 or 9 pound bone in pork shoulder (also known as a "[Boston butt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork_shoulder)"). If you look closely at the photos you will notice that the pork shoulder is on average about 75% cheaper per pound than the ribs. However, it will taste as good as the ribs, and you will certainly have some people who prefer it.

## The night before smoking:

To prepare the ribs just remove them from the packaging and rinse them off. Then we have to remove the "[silver skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia)" (or Fascia) from the inside of the rib cages. Removing the silver skin helps the rub reach all the parts of the meat on the ribs and eliminates the stringy-ness of ribs.
<blockquote>Plenty of chefs will tell you leave the silver skin on the ribs to help the hold together. They are wrong. You want ribs so tender they fall apart, then pull the darn silver skin off!</blockquote>
Use a paper towel to grip the silver skin with your hand and pull it off. I've never have had to slip a knife under the skin to get it to peel, but you might have different results. It should take you about 5 minutes to prep to racks of ribs.

Here is a video demonstration (from [BarbequeTricks.com](http://barbecuetricks.com/)) of removing the silver skin:
