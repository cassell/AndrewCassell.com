# The Best Damn Smoked Ribs and Pulled Pork

This simple recipe and guide will teach you how to make exceptional [Kansas City-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City-style_barbecue) smoked baby back ribs and pulled pork that are better than all but the top echelon of BBQ restaurants. For an example of BBQ this won't beat go to [Oklahoma Joe's in Kansas City, Kansas](http://oklahomajoesbbq.com/). We'll be making 2 full racks of ribs and an 9 pound pork shoulder. This will be enough to serve 6-8 very hungry adults, with everybody getting a few ribs and plenty of pulled pork. This is about max capacity on my Weber Smokey Mountain smoker without using a [rack system for the ribs](http://store.weber.com/accessories/category/cook/cookware/1280).

<blockquote>Note: I've <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development">iterated</a> several times on this recipe and will continue to make updates if I am able to improve it.</blockquote>

## A day or two before smoking:
Ok, let's start with the ribs: Buy baby back ribs. They will taste better and be less fatty than spare ribs. They will only cost a little bit more (if you are going spend a day cooking then you deserve it). Buy ribs that look like they are meaty, trimmed well, and don't show any bone through the inside of the rib cage (these are called "[shiners](http://www.weber.com/weber-nation/grill-skills/mastering-ribs/know-your-cuts__1/what-is-a-shiner)"). I've had great luck with baby back ribs from Wegman's, Whole Foods, and Trader Joes. Buy ribs that are fresh and far from the expiration date.
<blockquote>Note: I'm still iterating my spare rib recipe and if I can make them as good as the baby backs I will post results.</blockquote>

For the pork shoulder I typically buy an 8 or 9 pound bone in pork shoulder (also known as a "[Boston butt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork_shoulder)"). If you look closely at the photos you will notice that the pork shoulder is on average about 75% cheaper per pound than the ribs. However, it will taste as good as the ribs, and you will certainly have some people who prefer it.

## The night before smoking:
We're going to prep our meat, rub our meat, and put it back in the refrigerator so the rub has some time to setup and stick to the meat.

### Let's make our rub
Just mix the following 6 ingredients in a bowl with a fork:
<ul>
	<li>2 tbsp of kosher salt</li>
	<li>2 tbsp of garlic powder</li>
	<li>2 tbsp of ground black pepper</li>
	<li>2 tbsp of ground cumin</li>
	<li>2 tbsp of chili powder</li>
	<li>4 tbsp of brown sugar</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Note: I've tried to reduce the rub to the simplest list of ingredients I could make and still have it be freaking delicious. I've tried adding mustard, honey, maple syrup, whiskey and other things to the rub.</blockquote>


### Prepare the Baby Back Ribs
To prepare the ribs just remove them from the packaging and rinse them off. Place them on a cookie sheet. I cover the cookie sheet in aluminum foil to ease cleanup (and I have a lot of old rusty cookie sheets). Then we have to remove the "[silver skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia)" (or Fascia) from the inside of the rib cages. Removing the silver skin helps the rub reach all the parts of the meat on the ribs and eliminates the stringy-ness of ribs.
<blockquote>Plenty of chefs will tell you leave the silver skin on the ribs to help the hold together. They are wrong. You want ribs so tender they fall apart, then pull the darn silver skin off!</blockquote>
Use a paper towel to grip the silver skin with your hand and pull it off. I've never have had to slip a knife under the skin to get it to peel, but you might have different results. It should take you about 5 minutes to prep to racks of ribs.

Here is a video demonstration (from [BarbequeTricks.com](http://barbecuetricks.com/)) of removing the silver skin:

Spread the rub all over both sides of the ribs. Place the ribs on a cookie sheet. Cover the ribs in aluminum foil or syran wrap. Place them back in the refrigerator overnight.



### Prepare the Boston Butt
To prepare the boston butt I removed it from the packaging and rinsed the roast. I then trimmed a lot of the fat an separated the roast into two 4 pound roasts. This will cut our cooking time in half. Make sure to remove any "flappy" pieces that might cause the rub to get stuck inside and not be able to form a crispy edge.

Spread the rub all over every side of the roasts. Place the roasts on a cookie sheet. Cover the roasts in aluminum foil or syran wrap. Place them back in the refrigerator overnight.

## A few hours before smoking:

### Soak the wood
For this recipe we'll be using a mix of cherry wood and pecan wood chips. The cherry is going to add a nice sweet smoke to the meat, while the pecan will add a more complex flavor.

Pour the woodchips into a container, mix them up, and pour water into the container until it covers all of the wood chips and some begin to float.
