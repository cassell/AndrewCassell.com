# php[tek] Presentation on No Modes

I attended the [2014 php[tek] conference](http://tek14.phparch.com/) and gave a talk entitled "[No Modes â€“ The Future of all Web Applications](http://tek.phparch.com/speakers/#65740)". It was an hour long talk about the history of modes in computing and designing modeless interfaces:
