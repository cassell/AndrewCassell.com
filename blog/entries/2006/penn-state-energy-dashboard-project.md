# Energy Dashboard Design Project

In 2006, as part of a senior design project, I worked with three other students to develop a prototype energy monitoring product for a house.
Eventually, I would take the prototype a step further to compete as part of the Penn State Solar Decathlon Team on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. in 2007.
