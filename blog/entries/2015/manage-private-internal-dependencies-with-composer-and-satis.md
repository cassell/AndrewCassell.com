# php[tek] 2015 Presentation: "Manage Private Internal Dependencies With Composer and Satis"

I was invited to speak at the [2015 php[tek] conference](http://tek15.phparch.com/) and gave a talk entitled "[Manage Private Internal Dependencies With Composer and Satis](https://tek15.phparch.com/speakers/#65740)". It was a 30 minute long talk about setting up and using Composer to pull open-source packages from public repositories on packagist.org, creating your own private/corporate package management server using Satis, and going through an example of how to integrate your own private code packaging server into your daily development workflow.
