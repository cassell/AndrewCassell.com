# php[tek] 2014 Presentation - PHP Closures

I attended the [2014 php[tek] conference](http://tek14.phparch.com/) and gave a talk entitled "[Obtaining Closure with Anonymous Functions](https://tek14.phparch.com/speakers/#65740)". It was a short talk of 30 minutes that described how to use functional programming techniques in PHP. It covered:

- lambda functions
- anonymous functions
- closures
- the Y-combinator
- memoization and caching
- monads
- dependency injection
- reducing code complexity
- avoiding common coding pitfalls
