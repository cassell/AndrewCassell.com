# PHP Serbia

I had the honor and privilege of being invited to Belgrade, Serbia to present my talk "Domain-driven Design Deconstructed" to the [PHP Serbia Conference](http://www.conf2017.phpsrbija.rs/). It was an amazing trip getting to see a fanastic country, meet great people, and attend an excellent conference.
