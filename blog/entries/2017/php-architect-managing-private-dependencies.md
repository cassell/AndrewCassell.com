# PHP[Architect] Magazine Article - Managing Private Dependencies

An article I authored was published in the October 2017 issue of the PHP\[Architect\] magazine.

	Summary: Using Composer and a private package server is the most efficient way to manage private dependencies with PHP. I recommend using the software as a service, Private Packagist, or Satis, the open source, self-hosted package server. In this article, Iâ€™ll show you how to easily set this up for your own projects.
