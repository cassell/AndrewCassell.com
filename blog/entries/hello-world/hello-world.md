# Hello World!

A [hello world]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world) program is usually the first program a developer makes when either first learning to program or testing out a new language or framework. This is page where you will probably first get to know me. 

I'm a full-stack Web Application Developer living in Herndon, Virginia whose focus is on exemplary user experiences.  I do graphic design, front-end application development (JavaScript, jQuery, etc.), and backend development in many different languages such as PHP, Ruby, .NET, Python, and JavaScript (Node.js). I also have plenty of experience using SQL and NoSQL databases.


I'm a graduate of [The Pennsylvania State University](http://www.psu.edu) with a degree in [Computer Engineering](http://www.cse.psu.edu). At Penn State I developed household energy monitoring hardware and software, a [website](http://solar.psu.edu/2007/default.aspx?lang=en), and communications materials for a [solar powered home](http://solar.psu.edu/2007/default.aspx?lang=en). I gained experience in the manufacturing industry doing robotics PLC programming, manufacturing data processing, and software development on two separate 9 month Co-Ops with [R.A. Jones](http://www.rajones.com) and [Sony](http://www.sony.com).

Since 2007, I've worked at the [Marine Spill Response Corporation](http://www.msrc.org).
