<p>The Solar Decathlon is a competition in which 20  teams of college and university students compete to design, build, and operate the most attractive, effective, and energy-efficient solar-powered house. The Solar Decathlon is also an event to which the public is invited to observe the powerful combination of solar energy, energy efficiency, and the best in home design.</p>
<p>The event takes place in fall 2007 on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The teams' houses and the sponsors' educational exhibits form a solar village.</p>
<p>The ten contests that make up the solar decathlon are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architecture</a> — 200 points</li> 
<li>Engineering</a> — 150 points</li> 
<li>Market Viability</a> — 150 points</li> 
<li>Communications</a> — 100 points</li> 
<li>Comfort Zone</a> — 100 points</li> 
<li>Appliances</a> — 100 points</li> 
<li>Hot Water</a> — 100 points</li> 
<li>Lighting</a> — 100 points</li> 
<li><a href="energy_balance.html" style="text-decoration:none;">Energy Balance</a> — 100 points</li> 
<li>Getting Around</a> — 100 points</li> 
</ul>
<p>Teams of college students design a solar house, knowing from the outset that it must be powered entirely by the sun. In a quest to stretch every last watt of electricity that's generated by the solar panels on their roofs, the students absorb the lesson that energy is a precious commodity. They strive to innovate, using high-tech materials and design elements in ingenious ways. Along the way, the students learn how to raise funds and communicate about team activities. They collect supplies and talk to contractors. They build their solar houses, learning as they go.</p>
<p>The 20 teams transport their solar houses to the competition site on the National Mall and virtually rebuild them in the solar village. Teams assemble their houses, and then the active phase of the Solar Decathlon begins with an opening ceremony for students, media, and invited guests. The teams compete in contests, and even though this part of the Solar Decathlon gets the most attention, the students really win the competition through the many months of fund raising, planning, designing, analyzing, redesigning, and finally building and improving their homes. The public is invited to tour the solar homes and event exhibits during much of the competition.</p>
