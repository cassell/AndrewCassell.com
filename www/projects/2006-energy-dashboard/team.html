<p style="font-size:24px; color:#000099;"><b>Andrew Cassell</b><br>
<span style="font-size:18px; color:#666666"><i>Computer Engineering</i></span></p>
<p>Andrew is responsible for the research and design of the energy dashboard layout.  He built the display model, cut the aluminum faceplate, and the designed the graphics for the front of the display.  Andrew designed the look and feel of the LCD panels, and developed the code for the touch screens for the center LCD panel.  He built the power supply circuit for the side LCDs logic and backlights.  He designed and assembled the models power test outlet circuitry. He designed the group's web page and poster.</p>
<p>Andrew is a senior majoring in Computer Engineering.  He will graduate in May of 2007 and will be seeking full-time employment.  He has gained much of his experience on two cooperative education internships.  With R.A. Jones in Covington, Kentucky he worked with PLCs to develop high speed packaging equipment for the bottling and food industries.  With Sony Electronics in Mt. Pleasant, Pennsylvania he used PLCs and Java to develop a manufacturing defect data collection system.</p></div>

<p style="font-size:24px; color:#000099;"><b>Ryan Paul</b><br>
<span style="font-size:18px; color:#666666"><i>Electrical Engineering</i></span></p>
<p>Ryan is responsible for the research, design, and assembly of the Energy Dashboard sensors and displays.  He researched the requirements for the power sensor, purchased the correct sensor, and calibrated the device.  Ryan built the logic buffering circuits that protect the microcontroller and other logic chips.</p>
<p>Ryan is a senior majoring in Electrical Engineering with an emphasis in solid state devices.  Ryan graduates in December and is currently seeking an internship or full-time employment for the spring.  His project related experiences include circuit design, embedded microcontrollers, integrated circuits, and programming in C++ and Assembly.  This semester he will also be helping with the lighting, electrical, and day lighting team.</p></div>

<p style="font-size:24px; color:#000099;"><b>Teofil Rus</b><br>
<span style="font-size:18px; color:#666666"><i>Computer Engineering</i></span></p>
<p>Teofil is responsible for interfacing the microcontroller to the LCD displays. This included researching microcontrollers, physically wiring the microcontroller, configuring the ADC input, digital input, and output ports, configuring the embedded real-time operating system, maintaing the TCP/IP stack, and the RS-232 communication to the center LCD.</p>
<p>Teofil Rus is a senior computer engineering major at Penn State University.  His work experience includes a co-op with The Boeing Company in St. Louis, Missouri.  While at Boeing, Teofil worked in the F-18 Flight Simulation Laboratory and on the JUCAS X-45C development team, where he gained experience programming both high level scripting applications and low level embedded systems.</p></div>

<p style="font-size:24px; color:#000099;"><b>Vinay Thakker</b><br>
<span style="font-size:18px; color:#666666"><i>Computer Engineering</i></span></p>
<p>Vinay is responsible for the research and implemenation of the embedded logic.  This will include firmware design, programming and flashing the microchips, displaying output on the side LCD panels, as well as developing a physical interface that is both suitable for the current requirements of the dashboard, as well as expandable to accommodate future enhancements.</p>
<p>Vinay is a senior in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor is Business.  He plans on graduating with an undergraduate degree in May of 2007 and then hopes to pursue a Masters in Computer Engineering.  His main competency through project work that relates specifically to the Energy Dashboard is firmware development.  He has experience in programming in Assembly and C++.  He also has practical experience with general circuit design principles.</p></div>
